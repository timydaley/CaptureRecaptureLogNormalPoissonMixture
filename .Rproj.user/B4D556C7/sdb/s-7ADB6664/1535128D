The sampling is assumed to be Poisson according to the sample abundances, that is for species $i$ the probability that we observed exactly $j$ copies is $\\Pr ( x_{i} = j |  \\lambda_{i}) = \\lambda^{j}_{i} e^{- \\lambda_{i}} / j!$.  \n\nWe can assume that the abundances themselves follow a distribution, possibly due to prior information.  For example, in the case of next generation sequencing (NGS) of molecules amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the molecules are subjected to a fixed number of rounds of amplification.  At each stage of amplification a random fraction of the molecules are copied.  If the random fraction is assumed to be independently and identically distributed at every stage then the total abundance will be two raised to the power of a sum of iid random variables.  By the central limit theorem, the exponent can be approximated by a Normal distribution and therefore the abudances will follow a log-Normal distribution.\n\nThe log-Normal has a long but tumultuous history in species sampling models.  The log-Normal was originally proposed by Preston [Ecology, 1948](http://www.planta.cn/forum/files_planta/the_commonness_and_rarity_of_species_144.pdf) as an alternative to the Negative Binomial and log-series distribution put forth by Fisher, Corbett, and William [J Animal Ecology, 1943](http://www.math.mcgill.ca/~dstephens/556-2008/Papers/Fisher1943.pdf).  Closed form maximum likelihood estimators were presented in [Bulmer, Biometrics, 1974](http://hs225104.lx-server.de/data/ifaoe/wrrl/Methoden/Species-Abundance-Distribution/Abundance-Species-LPoisson-1.pdf) and available in the R package [poilog](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/poilog/index.html).  More recently, the log-Normal Poisson has been criticized as not an appropriate distribution for the abundances of species [Williamson and Gaston, J Animal Ecology, 2005](http://poel.io-warnemuende.de/tl_files/scripte/statistikseminar/williamsen_2005_lognormal.pdf).  Yet in some situations, such as those previously described, the log-normal distribution may be appropriate.  \n\n",
